## Presentation

Alumni at Le Wagon Bordeaux in Data Science (batch #864).  
Undergraduated in fundamental mathematics at Universit√© de Bordeaux in 2021.  
Currently settled in Bordeaux.  

I'm looking for new projets linked to Data Analysis, Machine Learning and/or Deep Learning.  

My final project at le Wagon can be found in the repo *equations*. The aim of the project was to recognize handwritten math symbols and convert them to LaTeX.
